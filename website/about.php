        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p id="about">We are BABA's Home, coinsisting of Ben Ferro, Al Chowdhury, Ben Turner and Anastasiia Sokolova. We are creating a device that 
            takes note of the time, date and temperature of any given location that the device is located in. This will be a Raspberry pi 
            due to it's small size and customisation to make this project work. <br><br>
            Our project will include a home observation system which takes in external information such as temperature, and future iterations
            potentially air quality index (AQI) and will provide this information to homeowners. Our customer would want to be able to view such 
            information about their home in an easy to understand and aesthetically pleasing way such as through a well-structured web 
            page to display this information. This could be useful in such cases where the user may have heath issues, such as allergies, 
            asthma, and respiratory infections and diseases
